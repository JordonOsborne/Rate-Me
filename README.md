# Rate Me

This project was modeled after the Udemy Course by Brad Traversy (React Front to Back 2022) [Feedback Application](https://github.com/bradtraversy/feedback-app). Using the teachings from the course I have modified them slightly with my own style and functionallity. A live version of this application can be found on the nelify server at [Rate Me](https://josborne-rate-me.netlify.app/).

Modifications to the model are noted below:
- Ratings changed from 1-10 to 1-5
- Rating selector changed from circles to stars (Change from radio select inputs to buttons)
- Validation on feedback form no longer requires comments
- Ratings without comments are filtered out of the feedback tiles but remain in the stats
